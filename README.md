MISSION
-------
Reportedâ€™s mission is to equip citizens and law enforcement officers with the right tool to help reduce non-life threatening crimes

THE PROBLEM
-------
There is no unified, efficient and trusted way for citizens and law enforcement officers to share data about crime/incidents with each other online. 
1. 911 service is often misused/abused by citizens
2. Misallocation of resources is a result of those abuses
3. Trust issues between Law Enforcement & the communities they serve
4. There's not enough staffing to actually answer the 911 calls
5. On average, it takes 18 mins for the police to arrive and in certain cases, they have very vague information about the incident/crime.

THE SOLUTION
-------
Reported streamlines the collection and dissemination of crime data between citizens and local law enforcements agencies through anonymous tips.

Reported not only helps citizens report crime with ease, but also provides a way to visualize crime data that matters to them right now, and to make better decisions based on that information. 

With its mobile-ready platform, Reported lets Law Enforcement officers manage crime data and users, even on the go. They can leverage its intuitive dashboard to make better decisions and allocate resources more efficiently.

BUSINESS APPLICATIONS
-------
* **Public Safety:** Reported can be used by citizens to protect the communities they live in, by sharing crime information

* **Governments & Law Enforcement:** Law Enforcement agencies can leverage Reported to manage incoming tips on the go
